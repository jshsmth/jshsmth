# Bringing brand personality to life through design and code

## Software Engineer | UX Designer

I build digital products where engineering precision meets design thinking. Based in Melbourne, I specialize in creating interfaces that people genuinely love using, from payment systems processing millions of transactions to gesture-driven mobile trading experiences.

### What I've Built

**At Tyro Health (4+ years)**, if you've tapped your phone to pay at a healthcare clinic in Australia, you've likely used software I built:
- Led payment experiences processing **millions of monthly transactions** (Apple Pay, Google Pay, card payments)
- Rebuilt legacy UI component library with Tailwind CSS, **accelerating delivery by 40%**
- Contributed to **$500,000+ in business savings** through seamless payment migration
- Designed accessibility system for point-of-sale devices through user research with people with disabilities
- Maintained Health SDK enabling **1M+ monthly invoice processing**

**As a contractor**, I've helped startups ship mobile and web products from concept to launch:
- Built complete **mobile trading app** as sole frontend engineer at Mythic Labs, creating AI-native UX with gesture-based trading and real-time WebSocket streaming
- Architected swipe-to-trade execution with **sub-second Solana transactions**
- Improved Lighthouse scores by **25%** through performance optimization at PLAYA3ULL GAMES
- Created real-time trading platforms integrating AI chat, live charts, and DeFi infrastructure
