## Hey there! 👋

I'm a Software Developer based in Melbourne. I'm passionate about Web3 because I believe in a future where individuals have control over their data. In a world where governments and corporations frequently compromise user privacy through data breaches, surveillance, and unauthorized data sharing, blockchain technology offers a path to true data sovereignty and security. I'm committed to improving the user experience of Web3 applications, making them more intuitive and accessible to everyone, so that the benefits of decentralization can be understood and utilized by the average person.
